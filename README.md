[fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm): Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for Fortran, from fortran-lang

[jams_makefile](https://github.com/mcuntz/jams_makefile): provides a portable, versatile way of compiling Fortran, C, C++, and mixed projects, by mcuntz

[meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson): next-generation build system

[mkhelper](https://github.com/skosukhin/mkhelper): collection of utilities to be used with GNU Autoconf and GNU Make for building Fortran projects, by skosukhin

[run-fortran](https://github.com/lycantropos/run-fortran): sorting Fortran files based on modules definitions and usages, by lycantropos

### Compilers
[f18-llvm-project](https://github.com/flang-compiler/f18-llvm-project): fork of llvm/llvm-project for f18. In sync with f18-mlir and f18.

[flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang): flang (also known as "Classic Flang") is an out-of-tree Fortran compiler targeting LLVM. It is an open-sourced version of pgfortran, a commercial Fortran compiler from PGI/NVIDIA

[lfortran](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran): modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user's code interactively to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user's code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

[ompi](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi): open source Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners

### Indentation
[ajt-fortran.vim](https://github.com/robertodr/ajt-fortran.vim): port of Ajit J. Thakkar's Vim indent script

[findent](https://github.com/MFTabriz/findent): indent and convert Fortran sources, by wvermin and MFTabriz

[FortranIndent](https://github.com/Kairzhan/FortranIndent): tools to indent Fortran 90 sources, from Kairzhan

[IndentPatternFortran](https://github.com/JHenneberg/IndentPatternFortran): general indentation patterns for Fortran, by JHenneberg

### Parallel Programming
[hipfort](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipfort): Fortran Interface For GPU Kernel Libraries

[mpich](https://github.com/pmodels/mpich): high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
MPI-3.1 standard from the Argonne National Laboratory

[OpenCoarrays](https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/opencoarrays): supports Fortran 2018 compilers by providing a parallel application binary interface (ABI) that abstracts away the underlying parallel programming model, which can be the Message Passing Interface (MPI) or OpenSHMEM, 
from sourceryinstitute

### Preprocessors
[fortiel](https://github.com/Jhuighuy/fortiel): Fortran preprocessor and metaprogramming engine, by Jhuighuy

[fypp](https://github.com/aradi/fypp): Python-powered preprocessor, by aradi. It can be used for any programming languages but its primary aim is to offer a Fortran preprocessor, which helps to extend Fortran with condititional compiling and template metaprogramming capabilities

[prep](https://github.com/urbanjost/prep): Fortran pre-processor written in Fortran, by urbanjost

### Static Analysis
[camfort](https://github.com/camfort/camfort): refactoring and verification tool for scientific Fortran programs. It currently supports Fortran 66, 77, and 90 with various legacy extensions.
