### Fortran tools on GitHub -- compilers, preprocessors, static analyzers, transpilers, and interoperability tools

[camfort](https://github.com/camfort/camfort): refactoring and verification tool for scientific Fortran programs. It currently supports Fortran 66, 77, and 90 with various legacy extensions.

[flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang): flang (also known as "Classic Flang") is an out-of-tree Fortran compiler targeting LLVM. It is an open-sourced version of pgfortran, a commercial Fortran compiler from PGI/NVIDIA

[fortiel](https://github.com/Jhuighuy/fortiel): Fortran preprocessor and metaprogramming engine, by Jhuighuy

[fortran-callgraph](https://github.com/hydro-jules/fortran-callgraph): Tool to create call graphs from JULES source code

[fossil](https://github.com/nrwade0/Fossil): Fortran IDE designed in Python by someone eager to learn Fortran but in an easy and accessible way, by nrwade0

[hipfort](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipfort): Fortran Interface For GPU Kernel Libraries

[i-CodeCNES](https://github.com/cnescatlab/i-CodeCNES): static code analysis tool to help developers write code compliant with CNES coding rules for Fortran 77, Fortran 90 and Shell, from cnescatlab

[irep](https://github.com/LLNL/irep): tool for filling C/C++ or Fortran data structures from Lua input tables, from LLNL

[jams_makefile](https://github.com/mcuntz/jams_makefile): provides a portable, versatile way of compiling Fortran, C, C++, and mixed projects, by mcuntz

[lfortran](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran): modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user's code interactively to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to binaries with the goal to run user's code on modern architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

[mkhelper](https://github.com/skosukhin/mkhelper): collection of utilities to be used with GNU Autoconf and GNU Make for building Fortran projects, by skosukhin

[mpich](https://github.com/pmodels/mpich): high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
MPI-3.1 standard from the Argonne National Laboratory

[ompi](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi): open source Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners

[prep](https://github.com/urbanjost/prep): Fortran pre-processor written in Fortran, by urbanjost

[run-fortran](https://github.com/lycantropos/run-fortran): sorting Fortran files based on modules definitions and usages, by lycantropos

[xcc-project](https://github.com/JianpingZeng/xcc-project): C/C++/Fortran compiler collection written in Java, by JianpingZeng
